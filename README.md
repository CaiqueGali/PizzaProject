# 2ยบ The Solution
- To solve this problem that directly affected the pizzeria's revenue, I used the TKInter library, in Python, to create the GUI (Visual Application Model) and represent how the user could choose their tables and other features, this is a real project developed with the aim of helping pizzerias to learn more about the world's new technologies.
